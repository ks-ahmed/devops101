# 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫 𝐯𝐬 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲 – 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭’𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐃𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞? 

Ever wonder what happens behind the scenes when you visit a website that just works — even during heavy traffic?
Two common terms you'll hear in web infrastructure are Load Balancer and Reverse Proxy. While they can seem similar, they serve slightly different purposes:

## 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲:
Think of it as a smart receptionist at a busy office. It takes your request (like visiting a website) and passes it to the right server behind the scenes — often handling things like caching, SSL termination, or filtering.

## 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫:
Now imagine a team leader who evenly distributes incoming work across a team. A load balancer makes sure no single server is overwhelmed by spreading requests across multiple servers for speed and reliability.

## Fun fact: 𝐀 𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐛𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫 𝐢𝐬 𝐚 𝐭𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲, but not all reverse proxies are load balancers!

## In short:

- 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲 = One server that routes your requests to others
- 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫 = One server that balances your requests across multiple others

**Learning these concepts is key to understanding modern web architecture!**

# So one might ask; 𝐍𝐆𝐈𝐍𝐗 𝐯𝐬 𝐀𝐖𝐒 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫 – 𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐡 𝐎𝐧𝐞 𝐒𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐔𝐬𝐞? 

Both NGINX and AWS Load Balancer help distribute traffic and keep your web apps fast and reliable — but they serve different purposes and shine in different use cases.
Here’s a simple breakdown:

## 𝐍𝐆𝐈𝐍𝐗 – Open-source web server & reverse proxy
Great for:

- Small to mid-sized apps
- Custom configurations
- Self-managed infrastructure
- Acting as a reverse proxy + load balancer in one

**Use Case: Hosting your own web server or running on a VPS (like EC2) and want full control.**

---

## 𝐀𝐖𝐒 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫 – Fully managed cloud load balancing
Great for:

- Scalable, cloud-native apps
- Zero maintenance
- Auto-scaling with EC2, ECS, etc.
- Integration with other AWS services

**Use Case: Running an app on AWS and want plug-and-play, high-availability load balancing with less manual work.**

## 𝐐𝐮𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲:
NGINX = Your custom-built tool belt 
AWS Load Balancer = A plug-in smart system that scales with you 

💡 **Tip: You can even use 𝐍𝐆𝐈𝐍𝐗 𝐛𝐞𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐝 𝐚𝐧 𝐀𝐖𝐒 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫 for extra control!**

# 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐃𝐍𝐒 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐃𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐈𝐭 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐤..? 🌐

Have you ever wondered how typing something like **𝐰𝐰𝐰.𝐠𝐨𝐨𝐠𝐥𝐞.𝐜𝐨𝐦** magically brings up a website in your browser? 
That behind-the-scenes magic is handled by something called **𝐃𝐍𝐒, or 𝐃𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐍𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦**—think of it as the internet’s phone book!

Let’s take a fun and simplified journey through how DNS works:

1️⃣ **𝐄𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐖𝐞𝐛𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐞 – 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐁𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐬**
When you type a domain name into your browser, your computer doesn't actually understand words—it needs the IP address of the website to connect to it.

To find that address, it asks a helper called a DNS Resolver—usually provided by your internet provider or Wi-Fi setup. Think of it as your device’s personal internet guide.

2️⃣ **𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐜𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 – 𝐈𝐬 𝐈𝐭 𝐀𝐥𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐲 𝐊𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐧?**
Before asking around, the DNS resolver checks its own memory (called a cache) to see if it already knows the answer from a recent search.

✅ If it does, great! It gives your computer the answer instantly.
❌ If it doesn't, the resolver starts a detective mission…

3️⃣ **𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐃𝐍𝐒 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐆𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐇𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 (𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧)**
If the IP isn’t cached, the resolver says, “Let’s figure it out.”

 - It first contacts a Root DNS Server: “Hey, where can I find info on .com domains?”
 - The root server replies, “Talk to the .com TLD server for that.”
 Now, the resolver is one step closer.

4️⃣ **𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐓𝐋𝐃 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐏𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐖𝐚𝐲**
The resolver then contacts the TLD server (for .com, in our example) and asks:
 “Do you know where to find googles domain?”

The TLD server replies, “Yes! Here's the authoritative name server for that domain.”

5️⃣ **𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐍𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐆𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐀𝐧𝐬𝐰𝐞𝐫**
This is the server that truly knows the answer. It’s responsible for the domain and holds the correct IP address.

The resolver asks, What's the IP address for google?
The server replies with googles IP address.

6️⃣ **𝐒𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐧𝐬𝐰𝐞𝐫 (𝐂𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠)**
The resolver says, “Thanks!” and then stores that IP address in its memory for a set amount of time so it doesn’t have to go searching again next time.

he right service based on path/host rules.

7️⃣ **𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐧𝐬𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐭𝐨 𝐘𝐨𝐮**
Now that the resolver has the IP address, it sends it back to your device.

8️⃣ **𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐖𝐞𝐛𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐞 – 𝐘𝐨𝐮’𝐫𝐞 𝐓𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞!**
Finally, your computer uses the IP address to connect to the actual web server where the website lives. That server sends back the website’s content, and…

 🎉 **𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐛𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐬𝐞𝐫!**

### Thanks to 𝐃𝐍𝐒, you don’t need to memorize long strings of numbers—you just use simple names like amazon or openai and the internet does the rest.
