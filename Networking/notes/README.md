# 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫 𝐯𝐬 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲 – 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭’𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐃𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞? 

Ever wonder what happens behind the scenes when you visit a website that just works — even during heavy traffic?
Two common terms you'll hear in web infrastructure are Load Balancer and Reverse Proxy. While they can seem similar, they serve slightly different purposes:

## 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲:
Think of it as a smart receptionist at a busy office. It takes your request (like visiting a website) and passes it to the right server behind the scenes — often handling things like caching, SSL termination, or filtering.

## 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫:
Now imagine a team leader who evenly distributes incoming work across a team. A load balancer makes sure no single server is overwhelmed by spreading requests across multiple servers for speed and reliability.

## Fun fact: 𝐀 𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐛𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫 𝐢𝐬 𝐚 𝐭𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲, but not all reverse proxies are load balancers!

## In short:

- 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲 = One server that routes your requests to others
- 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫 = One server that balances your requests across multiple others

**Learning these concepts is key to understanding modern web architecture!**

Both NGINX and AWS Load Balancer help distribute traffic and keep your web apps fast and reliable — but they serve different purposes and shine in different use cases.
Here’s a simple breakdown:

## 𝐍𝐆𝐈𝐍𝐗 – Open-source web server & reverse proxy
Great for:

- Small to mid-sized apps
- Custom configurations
- Self-managed infrastructure
- Acting as a reverse proxy + load balancer in one

**Use Case: Hosting your own web server or running on a VPS (like EC2) and want full control.**

## 𝐀𝐖𝐒 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫 – Fully managed cloud load balancing
Great for:

- Scalable, cloud-native apps
- Zero maintenance
- Auto-scaling with EC2, ECS, etc.
- Integration with other AWS services

**Use Case: Running an app on AWS and want plug-and-play, high-availability load balancing with less manual work.**

NGINX = Your custom-built tool belt 
AWS Load Balancer = A plug-in smart system that scales with you
