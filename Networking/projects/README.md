# 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐃𝐍𝐒 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐃𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐈𝐭 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐤..? 🌐

Have you ever wondered how typing something like **𝐰𝐰𝐰.𝐠𝐨𝐨𝐠𝐥𝐞.𝐜𝐨𝐦** magically brings up a website in your browser? 
That behind-the-scenes magic is handled by something called **𝐃𝐍𝐒, or 𝐃𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐍𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦**—think of it as the internet’s phone book!

Let’s take a fun and simplified journey through how DNS works:

1️⃣ **𝐄𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐖𝐞𝐛𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐞 – 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐁𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐬**
When you type a domain name into your browser, your computer doesn't actually understand words—it needs the IP address of the website to connect to it.

To find that address, it asks a helper called a DNS Resolver—usually provided by your internet provider or Wi-Fi setup. Think of it as your device’s personal internet guide.

2️⃣ **𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐜𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 – 𝐈𝐬 𝐈𝐭 𝐀𝐥𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐲 𝐊𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐧?**
Before asking around, the DNS resolver checks its own memory (called a cache) to see if it already knows the answer from a recent search.

✅ If it does, great! It gives your computer the answer instantly.
❌ If it doesn't, the resolver starts a detective mission…

3️⃣ **𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐃𝐍𝐒 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐆𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐇𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 (𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧)**
If the IP isn’t cached, the resolver says, “Let’s figure it out.”

 - It first contacts a Root DNS Server: “Hey, where can I find info on .com domains?”
 - The root server replies, “Talk to the .com TLD server for that.”
 Now, the resolver is one step closer.

4️⃣ **𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐓𝐋𝐃 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐏𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐖𝐚𝐲**
The resolver then contacts the TLD server (for .com, in our example) and asks:
 “Do you know where to find googles domain?”

The TLD server replies, “Yes! Here's the authoritative name server for that domain.”

5️⃣ **𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐍𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐆𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐀𝐧𝐬𝐰𝐞𝐫**
This is the server that truly knows the answer. It’s responsible for the domain and holds the correct IP address.

The resolver asks, What's the IP address for google?
The server replies with googles IP address.

6️⃣ **𝐒𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐧𝐬𝐰𝐞𝐫 (𝐂𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠)**
The resolver says, “Thanks!” and then stores that IP address in its memory for a set amount of time so it doesn’t have to go searching again next time.

he right service based on path/host rules.

7️⃣ **𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐧𝐬𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐭𝐨 𝐘𝐨𝐮**
Now that the resolver has the IP address, it sends it back to your device.

8️⃣ **𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐖𝐞𝐛𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐞 – 𝐘𝐨𝐮’𝐫𝐞 𝐓𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞!**
Finally, your computer uses the IP address to connect to the actual web server where the website lives. That server sends back the website’s content, and…

 🎉 **𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐛𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐬𝐞𝐫!**

### Thanks to 𝐃𝐍𝐒, you don’t need to memorize long strings of numbers—you just use simple names like amazon or openai and the internet does the rest.
