# **Bandit Wargame - An Introduction:**

Bandit Wargame is a great way to dive into the Linux command line, especially if you're just getting started. Created by OverTheWire, itâ€™s a hands-on, challenge-based game that guides you through the basics of working in a shell environment. Youâ€™ll learn how to run commands, move around directories, and pick up essential skillsâ€”all by solving a series of clever puzzles.

Each level gives you a task: find a hidden password somewhere in the system. Once you uncover it, youâ€™ll use that password to move on to the next level, gradually building your knowledge as you go.

## **How to Get Started:**

To jump into Bandit, youâ€™ll need to connect to their server using SSH (Secure Shell), which lets you securely access the remote system where the game is hosted.

Hereâ€™s what you need to do:

### **Connect to the Bandit Server:**
First, make sure SSH is installed on your computer. Then, open up your terminal (or use an SSH client) and run this command to connect:

``` bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
This command logs you into the Bandit server as the user bandit0. Once you're connected, you'll be asked to enter the password for level 0 to get started.

### **Password for Level 0**
The password for the first level (bandit0) is:

```bash
bandit0
```
