# Must-Know Commands: 🐧

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just stepping into the world of tech, one truth remains the same: **a solid foundation in the basics makes all the difference.**

My journey with Linux began during college, when I first installed Ubuntu out of sheer curiosity. I didn’t know it then, but that moment sparked a deep appreciation for **open-source systems**—and an understanding that real mastery starts at the **terminal prompt.**

Fast forward to today: Linux continues to power much of the modern world—from servers to smartphones to cloud infrastructure. Yet it all begins with understanding the essentials:

✅ The file system
✅ Command line navigation
✅ Package management
✅ Permissions and users
✅ Shell scripting

These aren’t just "beginner topics." They’re core competencies.

Whether you’re deploying containers or managing cloud infrastructure, **that foundational knowledge is what gives you confidence and flexibility to build and solve real-world problems.**
